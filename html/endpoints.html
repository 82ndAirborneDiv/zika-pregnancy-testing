        <li>Order Zika virus RNA nucleic acid test (NAT) on serum and urine specimens and Zika virus IgM on serum
            specimen. Dengue IgM serology should also be performed for patients at risk of exposure and with clinically
            compatible illness.
        </li>
        <li>Collect serum and urine specimens and/or other specimens deemed appropriate by the public health or commercial
            lab performing your testing. Collect enough specimen so that reflex testing can occur if needed.

    <strong>To order test:</strong> Healthcare and laboratory professionals are instructed to direct Zika virus testing
    requests to their local or state public health laboratory or to a commercial laboratory that performs Zika testing
    using a validated assay with demonstrated analytical and clinical performance. Healthcare and laboratory
    professionals should follow state or local public health department guidance on notification procedures for suspect

    Testing of asymptomatic pregnant women with recent possible exposure, but without ongoing exposure to Zika, is

        <li>a balanced assessment of risks and expected outcomes, and</li>

    Rationale: As the number of people reported with Zika infection in the Americas is declining, the pretest

    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> If you live in area where PRNT is recommended, continue to plaque reduction

    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Important reminders:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>
            It’s important to remember that Zika virus IgM test results might be difficult to interpret for pregnant
            women who have had exposure to any area with risk for Zika virus transmission before the current pregnancy.

            laboratory interpretation in the presence of dengue virus IgM results.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Action needed:</strong> Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for Zika and dengue viruses (or
    other flaviviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred) should be automatically performed on the same
    IgM-tested sample or a subsequently collected sample. If your designated laboratory does not have capacity to
    perform PRNT, work with your health department to submit a sample for further testing.

    <strong>Action needed:</strong> Await additional IgM test results. Zika virus-specific IgM antibodies develop
    during the first week of illness; therefore a negative NAT result does not indicate absence of a recent Zika

<div id="node32a">
    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> No Zika virus RNA detected. Zika virus infection during pregnancy cannot be ruled
    out. A negative Zika virus NAT does not exclude infection during pregnancy, because it represents a single point
    in time. Zika virus RNA levels decline over time, and the duration of presence of Zika virus RNA in serum and
    urine following infection vary among pregnant women.
    <br/><br/>
    For asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure but without a prior laboratory-confirmed
    diagnosis of Zika virus, NAT testing should be offered at the initial prenatal care visit with two additional
    tests during pregnancy. If your patient has already received three tests during pregnancy, monitor for signs and
    symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease. If patient develops symptoms of Zika virus infection, testing for
    Zika virus should be repeated.

<div id="node35">
    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Test results suggest acute maternal Zika virus infection. However, additional
    testing may be indicated.

    <strong>Action needed:</strong> Despite the specificity of NAT, false positive NAT results have been reported. In a
    pregnant woman with a positive NAT on serum or urine and a negative IgM result repeat testing on the original
    NAT-positive specimen. If repeat NAT is positive, results should be interpreted as evidence of acute Zika virus
    infection. If repeat NAT testing is negative, results are indeterminate and healthcare providers should repeat
    Zika virus IgM antibody testing on a serum specimen collected ≥ 2 weeks after symptom onset or possible exposure
    or specimen collection date. If subsequent IgM antibody test is positive, interpret as evidence of acute Zika
    virus infection but if negative, interpret as no evidence of Zika virus infection. For more information on

            *** Zika virus IgM positive result is reported as “presumptive positive or flavivirus infection” to denote the need to perform confirmatory PRNT titers against Zika virus, dengue virus, and other flaviviruses to which the person might have been exposed to resolve potential false-positive results that might have been caused by cross-reactivity or nonspecific reactivity. In addition, ambiguous test results (e.g., inconclusive, equivocal, and indeterminate) that are not resolved by retesting also should have PRNT titers performed to rule out a false-positive result. However, PRNT confirmation is currently not routinely recommended for persons living in Puerto Rico.</p>

    <strong>Interpretation of test result:</strong> Flavivirus infection, but the specific virus cannot be identified
    and timing of infection cannot be determined. For pregnant women without Zika virus exposure before the current
    pregnancy, a positive IgM result represents recent unspecified flavivirus infection.

    <strong>Action needed: Zika virus infection and disease are nationally notifiable conditions. Your patient meets criteria for

    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Because the chance of Zika virus infection is unknown in areas with Zika risk that
    do not have travel notices, routine testing is not recommended for pregnant women who do not have symptoms. However,
    testing is recommended for

    Healthcare providers can offer testing on a case-by-case basis for asymptomatic pregnant women who are concerned
    about Zika virus infection; however, pretest counseling should clearly convey the limitations associated with
    interpretation of test results.
