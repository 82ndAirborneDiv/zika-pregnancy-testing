    <strong>Clinical Management: </strong>For symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with possible Zika virus
    exposure who seek care >12 weeks after symptom onset or possible exposure, IgM antibody testing might be
    considered. If <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/pregnancy-outcomes.html">fetal abnormalities</a>
    are present, Zika virus RNA nucleic acid testing (NAT) should also be performed on maternal serum and urine. However, a negative IgM antibody
    test or NAT result >12 weeks after symptom onset or possible exposure does not rule out recent Zika virus
    infection because IgM antibody and viral RNA levels decline over time. Given the limitations of testing beyond 12
    weeks after symptom onset or possible exposure, serial fetal ultrasounds should be considered.

    <strong>Interpretation: </strong>Asymptomatic pregnant women at ongoing risk for Zika virus exposure should be

            defects, pregnancy losses, abnormal ultrasound findings) when they are identified. This could be a state, tribal, local, or territorial
            health department. Health department staff should notify CDC registry staff of adverse events.

            *For persons with suspected Zika virus disease, Zika virus real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain
            reaction (rRT-PCR) should be performed on serum specimens collected &lt;7 days after onset of symptoms, and
            on urine specimens collect &lt;14 days after onset of symptoms. <br><sup>†</sup>In the absence of rRT-PCR
            testing, negative IgM or neutralizing antibody testing in specimens collected &lt;7 days after illness
            onset might reflect collection before development of detectable antibodies and does not rule out infection
            with the virus for which testing was conducted.<br><sup>§</sup>Zika IgM positive result is reported as
            “presumptive positive” to denote the need to perform confirmatory PRNT.<br><sup>¶</sup>Report any positive
            or equivocal IgM Zika or dengue results to state or local health department.<br>**To resolve false-positive
            results that might be caused by cross-reactivity or nonspecific reactivity, presumptive positive Zika IgM
            results should be confirmed with PRNT titers against Zika, dengue, and other flaviviruses to which the
            person might have been exposed. In addition, equivocal and inconclusive results that are not resolved by
            retesting also should have PRNT titers performed to rule out a false-positive result.

    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> At this point, interpretation of the testing results suggests presumptive recent
    Zika virus or presumptive recent flavivirus infection.
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Action needed:</strong> Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for Zika and dengue viruses (or
    other flaviviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred) should be automatically performed on the same
    IgM-tested sample or a subsequently collected sample. If your designated laboratory does not have capacity to
    perform PRNT, work with your health department to submit a sample for further testing.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>Clinical management:</strong> For presumptive recent Zika virus infection or presumptive recent flavivirus
    infection, follow these <a href="#" onclick="event.preventDefault();

    clinical management recommendations</a>.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>To order test:</strong> Healthcare and laboratory professionals are instructed to direct Zika virus testing
    requests to their local or state public health laboratory or to a commercial laboratory that performs Zika testing
    using a validated assay with demonstrated analytical and clinical performance. Healthcare and laboratory
    professionals should follow state or local public health department guidance on notification procedures for suspect
    cases of Zika virus infection. Visit

<div id="testingNotRoutinelyRecommended">
    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Because the chance of Zika virus infection is unknown in areas with Zika risk that
    do not have travel notices, routine testing is not recommended for pregnant women who do not have symptoms. However,
    testing is recommended for
    <ul>
        <li>
            Any pregnant women with an epidemiologic link, regardless of symptom status, if
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/pregnancy-outcomes.html">signs</a>
            of congenital Zika virus syndrome are detected prenatally (e.g. intracranial calcifications, microcephaly,
            ventriculomegaly, and cerebral atrophy).
        </li>
        <li>
            Neonates if <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/pregnancy-outcomes.html">signs</a> (e.g.
            intracranial calcifications, microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, and cerebral atrophy) of congenital Zika virus
            syndrome are present.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Healthcare providers can offer testing on a case-by-case basis for asymptomatic pregnant women who are concerned
    about Zika virus infection; however, pretest counseling should clearly convey the limitations associated with
    interpretation of test results.

</div>
<div id="noEvidenceOfRecentZikaVirusInfection">
    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> No evidence of recent Zika virus infection.
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Recommendations for clinical management:</strong>
        Prenatal ultrasound to evaluate for fetal abnormalities consistent with congenital Zika virus syndrome.
        This includes microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, ventriculomegaly, arthrogryposis, and/or abnormalities
        of the corpus callosum, cerebrum, cerebellum, and eyes.
        <ul>
            <li>
                If fetal abnormalities are present, repeat Zika virus rRT-PCR and IgM test on the infant; base
                clinical management on corresponding laboratory results.
            </li>
            <li>
                If fetal abnormalities are absent, base obstetric care on the ongoing risk of Zika virus exposure
                in pregnant women.
